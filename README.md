## 🚀 About the Project

## 📜 One Commit to Rule Them All

> ### "Wait… why is there only one commit?"

Yeah, about that…

This project might *look* like I just dropped all the code in one big commit, and… you'd be right.

I originally worked on TireBay locally in a detached repo, mainly because:
- I didn’t plan on publishing it early.
- I was deep in the flow and didn't want to interrupt myself with granular commits.
- Some personal chaos (read: laptop drama + moving cities + a surprise power outage) meant I lost my original git history.

Rather than try to reconstruct a fake commit history, I decided to own it and push the fully functional code as-is.

So no, this isn’t some weird last-minute dump — the app is *actually done*, tested, and documented. 🙃
